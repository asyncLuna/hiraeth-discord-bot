Zenith is a reactive Spring Boot Discord bot for community utilities, Overwatch data, and server-specific automation.

The project is organized as a modular monolith: Discord events enter through Discord4J, commands and listeners delegate to focused feature modules, and shared services handle persistence, integrations, localization, and error reporting.

### Processing flows

1. Discord sends gateway events to the Discord4J client.
2. The command registry synchronizes global slash commands when the application starts.
3. Commands and component listeners execute feature workflows using reactive services.
4. Guild settings, account links, uwu locks, voting rounds, and votes are stored in MongoDB.
5. Overwatch and animal commands call their external APIs through WebClient-backed integrations with in-memory TTL caches.
6. Quartz opens, expires, and rotates Member of the Week voting rounds and the bot announces results in Discord.

MongoDB is the durable store for application state. External APIs are used for read-only game and animal content, while Sentry is optional and can be disabled by leaving its DSN empty.

## Features

- Global Discord slash-command registration with a small annotation-based command framework
- Overwatch player summaries, competitive ranks, hero data, hero statistics, maps, and top-hero statistics
- Discord-to-Overwatch account linking
- Anonymous confessions with optional replies, publishing channels, and author logs
- Member of the Week voting rounds with one-vote-per-member validation and scheduled rotation
- Server settings for confessions, voting, and moderation logs
- Message purging, colored role creation, predefined button workflows, and uwu locks
- Random animal images and facts
- English and Polish localization
- Reactive MongoDB persistence and WebClient integrations
- Optional Sentry error reporting, tracing, profiling, and log collection
- Docker Compose deployment with MongoDB and constrained container resources

## Technology stack

| Area | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Language | Java 21 |
| Framework | Spring Boot 4.0.6 |
| Discord | Discord4J 3.3.2 |
| Reactive runtime | Project Reactor, Spring WebFlux |
| Persistence | Spring Data MongoDB Reactive |
| Database | MongoDB 8.3.4 in Docker Compose |
| Scheduling | Quartz |
| External data | OverFast API, Animality API |
| Observability | Sentry Spring Boot integration |
| Testing | JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test, MongoDB reactive test support |
| Build | Gradle Kotlin DSL |

## Prerequisites

- JDK 21
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose, or an accessible MongoDB instance
- A Discord application and bot token
- A bot installation with the permissions required by the enabled commands

Zenith requests the `GUILDS`, `GUILD_MEMBERS`, `GUILD_MESSAGES`, `MESSAGE_CONTENT`, and `GUILD_MODERATION` gateway intents. Enable privileged intents in the Discord Developer Portal where required.

## Quick start

Copy the example environment file and set the Discord token and MongoDB credentials:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

For local development, start MongoDB through Docker Compose or use another MongoDB instance, then run:

```powershell
$env:DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = "your-discord-bot-token"
$env:SPRING_MONGODB_URI = "mongodb://zenith:change-this-password@localhost:27017/zenith?authSource=admin"
$env:SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE = "dev"
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

The bot connects to Discord and synchronizes global slash commands during startup. Global command changes can take time to propagate through Discord.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/animal` | Send a random animal image and fact. |
| `/confessions` | Enable or disable confession submissions. |
| `/create_role` | Create a colored role and assign it to a user. |
| `/hero_data` | Get data for an Overwatch hero. |
| `/hero_stats` | Browse statistics for a specific hero. |
| `/link` | Link an Overwatch account to a Discord account. |
| `/map` | Browse maps for an Overwatch game mode. |
| `/member_of_the_week` | Open, close, rotate, pause, or inspect voting rounds. |
| `/ping` | Check the bot's latency. |
| `/player_summary` | View an Overwatch player's summary and competitive ranks. |
| `/purge_messages` | Delete messages from a member. |
| `/send_button` | Send a predefined button workflow. |
| `/settings` | Configure Zenith for a server. |
| `/top_heroes` | View a player's most-played Overwatch heroes. |
| `/uwulock` | Manage user uwu blocks. |

## Configuration

The application reads secrets and connection details from environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Discord bot token. |
| `SPRING_MONGODB_URI` | Yes | MongoDB connection URI. |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | No | Use `dev` for development logging or `prod` for production settings. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | No | Sentry DSN; empty disables event reporting. |
| `SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII` | No | Whether Sentry may send default PII; defaults to `false`. |
| `SENTRY_LOGS_ENABLED` | No | Whether Sentry log collection is enabled. |

Member of the Week settings are under `zenith.member-of-the-week` in `src/main/resources/application.yaml` and can be overridden with Spring configuration properties.

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `guild-id` | configured in `application.yaml` | Guild used by the scheduled voting workflow. |
| `timezone` | `Europe/Warsaw` | Time zone used for scheduling and display. |
| `cron` | `0 0 18 ? * MON` | Opens a round on Mondays at 18:00. |
| `voting-duration` | `24h` | Duration of an automatic voting round. |

Do not commit `.env` files, bot tokens, database passwords, or Sentry DSNs.

## Docker Compose

Build the application JAR, then start MongoDB and the bot:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
.\gradlew.bat bootJar
docker compose up --build -d
```

View logs with:

```powershell
docker compose logs -f java
```

Stop the services with:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

MongoDB data is stored in the named `mongo-data` volume. Removing that volume permanently discards the local database.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test
```

The current test suite verifies that the Spring application context loads. MongoDB must be available through `SPRING_MONGODB_URI` when the context test is run.
